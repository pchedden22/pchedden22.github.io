          <h3>Driver Rewards Web App</h3>
          <p>
            A web application designed to help trucking companies reward their drivers
            with a customizable points-based system. Sponsors can allocate points based on performance, 
            and drivers can redeem them for rewards or donate to selected charities. The app features role-based 
            access, real-time points tracking, sponsor-specific settings, and seamless account management. 
            Built with AWS DynamoDB for scalable data storage and secure authentication, the platform ensures 
            a smooth and efficient experience for both sponsors and drivers.

          <h3>Sepsis Prediction Model</h3>
          <p>
            A machine learning model designed for early detection of sepsis using physiological 
            time-series data from the PhysioNet Sepsis Challenge dataset. The model predicts the likelihood 
            of sepsis six hours before clinical recognition by analyzing patient vitals and lab results 
            over time. Implemented custom feature engineering, trained models using logistic regression, SVM, 
            and other techniques, and evaluated performance with cross-validation. The project showcases 
            predictive analytics, medical AI, and time-series data processing.

          <h3>Connect 4 AI</h3>
          <p>
            A digital recreation of the classic Connect 4 game, built with a focus on smooth gameplay and 
            intuitive UI. Players take turns dropping colored discs into a 7x6 grid, aiming to connect 
            four in a row before their opponent. The app features real-time game logic, an interactive 
            interface, and AI-powered opponent options. Designed for both casual play and competitive strategy,
            it showcases game development, UI design, and algorithmic decision-making.

          <h3>Stock Market AI</h3>
          <p>
            An AI-powered stock trading model designed to analyze market trends and make predictive 
            trading decisions. Utilizing machine learning algorithms and historical stock data, the model 
            identifies potential buy and sell opportunities based on technical indicators, price movements, 
            and trend patterns. It features time-series forecasting, risk assessment, and backtesting capabilities 
            to evaluate performance. This project demonstrates expertise in financial modeling, predictive analytics, 
            and algorithmic trading strategies.
